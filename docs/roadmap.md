| ACPI | ✅ | ✅ | LAI (Lightweight ACPI Implementation) via C interop.  |
| Interrupt Handling | ✅  | ✅  | x64: APIC (Local + I/O). ARM64: GIC. |
| Memory Management | ✅ | ✅ ||
| Driver support | ✅ | 🟡 Partial | Only PCI on x64 |
| Garbage Collection | ✅ | ✅ | Mark-and-sweep GC |
| Filesystem | ✅ | 🟡 In progress |  |
| .NET core library features | 🟡 | 🟡 Partial | Core types work (String, Collections, List, Dictionary). Console, DateTime, Random, BitOperations plugged. Missing: `System.Math` (Sin/Cos/Tan/Log/Exp/Pow), `System.IO.File`. |
| Plug system | ✅ | ✅  |  |
| Test Framework | ✅ | ✅  |  |
| Debugger| ✅ | 🟡 Partial | Source link + variables bugs in vscode |
| CPU/FPU accelerated math | ✅ | 🟡 Minimal | SSE enabled but only used for memory operations. Software `ceil`/`sqrt` only. No hardware FPU math, no `System.Math` plug. |
| Cosmos Graphic Subsystem | ✅ | ✅ | UEFI GOP framebuffer via Limine only. |
| Network interface | ✅ | 🟡 Partial | x64 only, no ARM64 network driver. |
| Timer / Clock | ✅ | ✅ | |
| Keyboard Input | ✅ | ✅ | |
| Mouse Input | ✅ | ❌ | |
| Audio interface | 🟡 | ❌ | No audio, sound, or speaker support. |
